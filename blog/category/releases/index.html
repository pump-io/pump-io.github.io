            <p class="post-metadata">Published by Alex Jordan on <a href="/blog/2017/07/">July</a> 1, <a href="/blog/2017/">2017</a> in <a href="/blog/category/releases/" class="p-category">releases</a>
            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>pump.io 4.1 is out!</p>
<p>As usual, nothing much has changed since <a href="/blog/2017/06/out-now-pump.io-4.1-beta">the beta release</a>. This release includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minor web UI improvements</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity">Subresource Integrity</a> in the web UI</li>
<li>A switch to a pure-JavaScript bcrypt, which should improve installs on non x86 platforms and Docker</li>
<li>Some other <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#410-beta-0---2017-06-15">minor improvements and fixes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that <a href="/blog/2017/06/out-now-pump.io-4.1-beta">with this release</a>, Node 0.10 and Node 0.12 support is officially obsolete. This change paves the way for a lot of really important improvements, and in fact, we've already introduced a lot of changes that reduce technical debt. Note that since the beta announcement, Debian Stretch has been released, which ships Node 4 in <code>main</code>. You can read more about our Node.js support policy <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/wiki/Node.js-version-support">on our wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Enjoy the new release, and remember to <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/issues">report any bugs</a>!</p>

              <h2 class="p-name">Out now: pump.io 4.1 beta</h2></a>
            <p class="post-metadata">Published by Alex Jordan on <a href="/blog/2017/06/">June</a> 16, <a href="/blog/2017/">2017</a> in <a href="/blog/category/releases/" class="p-category">releases</a>
            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>Perhaps some of you were wondering where pump.io's 4.1 release was, since our <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/wiki/Release-cycle">release schedule</a> says it should've been released at the beginning of this month?</p>
<p>Well, wonder no longer. This release was unfortunately delayed because of some big stuff in my personal life that got in the way of free software stuff (sorry!), but as of yesteray, pump.io 4.1 is officially in beta! Huzzah!</p>
<p>This was a relatively minor release, primarily improving some aspects of the web UI. Notably, the pump.io 4.1 beta includes support for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity">Subresource Integrity</a>, a web standard which will improve security for users on nodes with <code>"noCDN": false</code> in their pump.io configurations. A more complete list of changes is available in the <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#410-beta-0---2017-06-15">change log</a>.</p>
<p>As always, we advise caution when upgrading to beta releases. Please <a href="">report</a> any problems or bugs you encounter.</p>
<p>pump.io 4.1 beta is a drop-in replacement for pump.io 4.0.</p>
<h3>First time contributors</h3>
<p>I would like to specially thank the following people, who contributed to the pump.io project for the first time during this release cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/vxcamiloxv">Camilo QS</a>, who contributed a number of improvements to the web UI</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bio-boris">@bio-boris</a>, who implemented <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Subresource_Integrity">Subresource Integrity</a> for the web UI</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/RyanRiddle">Ryan Riddle</a>, who made the web UI proactively warn if the user was trying to sign up with a blacklisted/reserved username (like <code>api</code> or <code>robots.txt</code>)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Node.js 0.10 and 0.12 support ending</h3>
<p>Finally, the stable release pump.io 4.1 will mark the end of pump.io's support for Node.js 0.10 and 0.12. These versions of Node are extremely old and are preventing us from making serious improvements to the codebase - you can see a list of these in <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/issues/1234">issue #1234</a>. Note that in particular we cannot simultaneously support Node 7 and Node 0.10 due to our browser unit testing library, Zombie.</p>
<p>With the exception of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS, there are <a href="https://nodecompat.com/">no major Linux distributions</a> not shipping Node 4+ in some form. Most of them ship it out-of-the-box; the only one that does not is Debian. For our admins on Debian, Node 4 is available in <code>jessie-backports</code> and will become the officially supported version with the release of Debian Stretch (which is imminent). Plus, for all of these platforms, NodeSource offers <a href="https://github.com/nodesource/distributions">binary packages</a> for all major Node versions that can be installed and managed through the system package manager. We'll also soon be making a Docker image available, which will allow people to run pump.io on any Docker-capable host, regardless of what Node version is shipped with their distribution.</p>
<p>You can read more about our Node.js version support policy <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/wiki/Node.js-version-support-policy">on our wiki</a>.</p>
<p>Here's to another pump.io beta!</p>

              <h2 class="p-name">pump.io XSS security releases available</h2></a>
            <p class="post-metadata">Published by Alex Jordan on <a href="/blog/2017/05/">May</a> 23, <a href="/blog/2017/">2017</a> in <a href="/blog/category/releases/" class="p-category">releases</a>
            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>Well, apparently I forgot to make a blog post announcing that pump.io 4.0.0 stable is out. Surprise! Besides the version number it's the same as <a href="http://pump.io/blog/2017/04/pump.io-4.0-in-beta">4.0 beta 5</a> anyway.</p>
<p>What is not the same as 4.0 beta 5, however, is the security releases I've just published. A semver-major release went out within the past 6 months, so per our <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/wiki/Security">security support policy</a>, we've released security patches for the past three stable releases:</p>
<ol>
<li>pump.io 4.0.0 has been updated to pump.io 4.0.1</li>
<li>pump.io 3.0.2 has been updated to pump.io 3.0.3</li>
<li>pump.io 2.1.1 has been updated to pump.io 2.1.2</li>
</ol>
<p>So what exactly required these releases? Well, the library we use to prevent cross-site scripting, <a href="https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify">DOMPurify</a>, released some security patches recently. While we could conceivably just tell pump.io users to rerun <code>npm install -g</code> to get the updated library, it seemed safer to issue patch releases that bumped the minimum version for DOMPurify and have people upgrade to those. This gives a 100% guarantee that pump.io users will be protected with the absolute latest DOMPurify version.</p>
<p>As with any security release, we encourage admins to upgrade ASAP. If you've already installed the 4.0 release via npm, that's great! That's our recommended configuration, and you'll be able to upgrade by issuing:</p>
<pre><code>$ npm install -g pump.io@4
</code></pre>
<p>If you're still on the 3.x release series, you really should <a href="https://pumpio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrades/3.x-to-4.x.html">upgrade to 4.x</a>, which contains significant work impacting security which was too big to go into a patch release (specifically, the upgrade to Express 4.x). But in the meantime, you can fix your XSS problems by running:</p>
<pre><code>$ npm install -g pump.io@3
</code></pre>
<p>And something similar if you're on 2.1.x:</p>
<pre><code>$ npm install -g pump.io@2
</code></pre>
<p>Though in this case it's even more urgent that you <a href="https://pumpio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrades/3.x-to-4.x.html">upgrade to 4.x</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the above comands also assume you have an npm-based install, which we strongly recommend. If you have a source-based install, you will need to upgrade however you usually do - this will depend on how exactly you have pump.io set up.</p>
<p>As always, if you need help, get in touch with <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/wiki/Community">the community</a>.</p>

              <h2 class="p-name">pump.io 4.0 in beta</h2></a>
            <p class="post-metadata">Published by Alex Jordan on <a href="/blog/2017/04/">April</a> 3, <a href="/blog/2017/">2017</a> in <a href="/blog/category/releases/" class="p-category">releases</a>
            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>pump.io 4.0.0 is officially in beta! Whooo!</p>
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>This is a positively <em>huge</em> release, and I'm so excited to share it with the community. Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Express 4.x - I wrote about the significance of this change <a href="http://pump.io/blog/2017/03/express-4.x-in-pump.io-core">here</a>, but suffice to say that this significantly improves security, performance, and future maintainability</li>
<li>Performance and correctness improvements to the web UI's JavaScript</li>
<li>Better administrative experience, including the ability to specify configuration via environment variables</li>
<li>Better interoperability with the <a href="https://indieweb.org">IndieWeb</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Upgrading</h3>
<p>The upgrade to Express 4.x and the improvements to configuration loading have the potential to break <em>some</em> existing pump.io installations, although 95% of installs should be completely unaffected. If you want to help test this beta, please set aside extra time as necessary to perform this upgrade - full documentation can be found on <a href="https://pumpio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/upgrades/3.x-to-4.x.html">ReadTheDocs</a>.</p>
<p>As always, this release will follow our normal <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/wiki/Release-cycle">release cycle</a>, which means that the stable 4.0.0 release will go out in about a month.</p>
<h3>Test days</h3>
<p>Due to the complexity of this upgrade, we've decided to have some test days during the beta where we upgrade prominent nodes for a day, then downgrade them again. This will help expose problems earlier and make the upgrade smoother for everyone. So far Jason Self, who runs <a href="https://datamost.com/">Datamost</a>, has volunteered for this - if you're interested in joining him, please <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/wiki/Community">get in touch</a>!</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p>

              <h2 class="p-name">Pump.io 2.0.4 is available</h2></a>
            <p class="post-metadata">Cross-posted from <a rel="canonical" href="https://strugee.net/blog/2016/11/pump.io-2.0.1-is-available">this post</a> by Alex Jordan on <a href="/blog/2016/11/">November</a> 11, <a href="/blog/2016/">2016</a> in <a href="/blog/category/releases/" class="p-category">releases</a>
            </p>
            <div class="e-content"><p>Greetings!</p>
<p>After a beta period of just over a week, pump.io 2.0.4 is now available on npm and GitHub. Whoohoo!</p>
<p>(This was originally going to be 2.0.0, but we had to do a couple patch releases due to some outdated documentation and several critical bugs. 2.0.4 is mostly the same thing as 2.0.0.)</p>
<h4>Changes</h4>
<p>Note that this release includes security improvements - namely, a newer Express version and a better TLS configuration - and therefore <strong>admins are encouraged to upgrade ASAP</strong>.</p>
<p>For the full list of changes, see <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#201---2016-11-10">the change log</a>.</p>
<h5>Breaking changes</h5>
<p>(As I said in <a href="">the beta announcement</a>:)</p>
<p>Pump.io 2.0.4 is a drop-in replacement for 1.0.0 <strong>unless</strong> you have any plugins configured or you modify the templates.</p>
<p>Plugins are likely to be affected by the upgrade to Express 3.x. The easiest way to migrate is probably to just run pump.io, test out the relevant parts of the app, and see where your plugin crashes. You might also want to look at the <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/master/History.md#300--2012-10-23">Express 3 change log</a>.</p>
<p>If you modified the templates, you'll be affected by the templates' rewrite from utml into Jade. Migration should be relatively painless but has to be done manually. Your best bet will be to save a copy of the diff you created, undo your changes, upgrade, then use the diff you saved to reintroduce your changes. You'll have to run <code>npm run build</code> after making changes to Jade files.</p>
<h5>Non-breaking changes</h5>
<p>This release is actually relatively minor in terms of non-breaking changes; however, we <em>do</em> have some nice new improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A pump(1) manpage is now included</li>
<li>Any internal web UI link with a <code>data-bypass</code> attribute is now ignored by the routing logic (useful for e.g. custom pages added by the admin)</li>
<li>YouTube links in posts are now shown as  embeds by the web UI (<a href="https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/master/History.md#300--2012-10-23">#1158</a>)</li>
<li>TLS connections now use Mozilla's "intermediate" cipher suite and forces server cipher suite preferences (<a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/issues/1061">#1061</a>)</li>
<li>Various minor fixes and improvements</li>
</ul>
<h4>Upgrading</h4>
<p>Upgrading is dead-simple. If you used our recommended install method, and installed from npm, you can upgrade with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo npm install -g pump.io@2
</code></pre>
<p>If you installed from source, you can upgrade with:</p>
<pre><code>git fetch
# If you modified templates, save the diff at this step
git checkout .
git checkout v2.0.4
npm install
# Restore your template changes
npm run lint:jade # Optional but recommended if you changed templates
npm run build
</code></pre>
<p>Both of these methods will work whether you're running 0.3.0, 1.0.0, or 2.0.0 beta. Make sure to restart pump.io after performing the upgrade.</p>
<h4>Getting help</h4>
<p>If you have any issues with the upgrade, get in touch with <a href="https://github.com/pump-io/pump.io/wiki/Community">the community</a>. You can also email me at <a href="mailto:alex@strugee.net">alex@strugee.net</a>.</p>

            <div class="e-content"><p>Greetings!</p>
<p>As pump.io is gearing up for our 2.0.0 release, I just published a beta to npm. We'd love it if any interested admins could upgrade their nodes and report any bugs you may run in to. (All bug reports are helpful, but just so we're clear, we're likely to only fix regressions from 1.0.0.)</p>

            <p class="post-metadata">Cross-posted from <a rel="canonical" href="https://strugee.net/blog/2016/08/pump.io-1.0.0-is-now-available">this post</a> by Alex Jordan on <a href="/blog/2016/08/">August</a> 26, <a href="/blog/2016/">2016</a> in <a href="/blog/category/releases/" class="p-category">releases</a> and <a href="/blog/category/code/" class="p-category">code</a>

            <div class="e-content"><p><a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/releases/tag/v1.0.0">Pump.io 1.0.0</a> is officially available! Whoooo!</p>
<p>I just wanted to write up an announcement real quick to celebrate. Here's a sample what's gone into this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Node 4.x support</li>
<li>Lots of security improvements including a better cross-site scripting scrubber and security-related headers that help protect the web UI (most notably, the web UI now declares a Content Security Policy)</li>
<li>Minor improvements to the API to make it (slightly) smarter</li>
<li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/">LibreJS</a> support</li>
<li>Numerous dependency upgrades, most notably Connect</li>
<li>And of course, tons of minor bugfixes and improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details, see the brand-new <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#100---2016-08-26">change log</a>.</p>
<p>And of course since we're now past 0.x.x releases, we're now officially making a commitment to the community to make only API-compatible changes going forward (or at least, until 2.0.0!).</p>
<p>As this release <em>does</em> improve security and fixes a lot of bugs, node administrators are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible. If you have a global, npm-based install, you can upgrade with:</p>
<pre><code>sudo npm install -g pump.io
</code></pre>
<p>And with a source-based install:</p>
<pre><code>git pull
git checkout v1.0.0
npm install --production
</code></pre>
<p>If you're upgrading from 0.3.0, everything should Just Work(tm). Don't forget to restart your daemon!</p>
<p>One final note - the rumors are true. While we're not doing so <em>yet</em>, we are, in fact, planning to deprecate running under Node.js 0.10 and 0.12 very soon. Also, if you upgrade to Node.js 4.x early, the new, better XSS scrubber will be enabled - <em>however</em>, be aware that pump.io is far less tested under Node.js 4.x and you are likely to run into more bugs than you would under 0.10 or 0.12. This is an unfortunate situation, but sadly there's really nothing to be done about it. :(</p>
<p>Special thanks to Menno Vossen, Laura Arjona, Evan Prodromou, Jan Kusanagi and all the other volunteers who did so many different things to make this release happen. It truly wouldn't have happened without you.</p>
<p>Enjoy the release!</p>
<p>With &#x3C;3,</p>
